# Stanford Resources for Phantom Development

This page serves as a directory for phantom prototyping resources at Stanford.

## SolidWorks Access

SolidWorks is proprietary software requiring a paid license and Windows operating system.

Stanford provides a [Virtual Cloud Desktop](https://virtualdesktop.stanford.edu/) service for students and members of the Stanford community which includes licensed access to SolidWorks via the “Windows GPU” virtual desktop.

Alternatively, students may have access to a free, local installation of SolidWorks through the Terman Library. A local Windows operating system is needed.

## Product Realization Lab

The [Product Realization Lab (PRL)](https://productrealization.stanford.edu/) supports all of the processes needed for phantom prototyping (i.e. 3D scanning, 3D printing). Materials are charged at-cost and machine time is available for free on a reservation basis. All Stanford students can access the space after completing a safety orientation process during the current academic year. The PRL can also provide great ad hoc support for learning new processes with peer support staff (CAs) on duty at all times. There are also many helpful tutorial documents for self-guided learning, as below.
