# SolidWorks Design Files

This folder includes all CAD files needed to modify the phantom design and generate new STL files for printing.

phantom.SLDASM is the top-level assembly file including all printed components. Many component part files (*.SLDPRT) include references to other part files in the assembly. In order to keep these references up-to-date it is recommended to keep phantom.SLDASM open while making any changes.

All files were created using SolidWorks 2023 (Education Edition).
