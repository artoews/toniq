# 3D Printing

This folder includes two files (STL and HTML) for each printed component of the phantom.

The STL files provide triangulated surface models of the phantom components. These serve as input files to a slicing application such as Cura.

The HTML files provide a complete specification of the Cura print settings for each component. These files were generated using the [Export HTML Cura Settings](https://marketplace.ultimaker.com/app/cura/plugins/5axes/HTMLCuraSettings) plug-in. Follow these steps for a quick view of just the user-modified print settings:
  1. Open the HTML file in a browser.
  2. Click "Visible settings".
  3. Click "User Modifications".
