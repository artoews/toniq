# Phantom Design & Fabricaton

Here are resources for developing modular implant phantoms like the one presented in the TONIQ paper.

The [printing](printing) folder includes all printing targets and settings needed to replicate the hip phantom from the paper. Commercial products used in this phantom are listed [here](product-links.md).

[Source design files](adapting-the-design.md) are also provided alongside [specific guidance](adapting-the-design.md) for adapting the design to whatever implant and container you have on hand. 

Stanford users may also find useful an (incomplete) summary of [campus resources](stanford-resources.md) for phantom developement.
